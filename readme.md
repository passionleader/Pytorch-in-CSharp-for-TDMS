# Embedding Pytorch Code in CSharp
Running Pytorch python Code in CSharp(NOT completed, this is for practice)
<br>
with pythonnet(C#, python), tdmsreader(C#)
<br>

There are many better projects than mine.
if need, visit https://github.com/dotnet/TorchSharp



## Purpose of This Project
* Sensor data is collected as a C# program(IoT)
* Machine learning models are implemented with pytorch
* To use these model, we need an intermediate place just like filesystem because operating language is not same
* So this project prepose direct way to apply pytorch model


## the existing method

## The way I want to implement it now is
